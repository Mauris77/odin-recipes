    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled asparagus is simple to make, but it lets you enjoy the natural flavor of your veggies. Fresh asparagus spears are coated with a bit of oil, salt, and pepper and cooked quickly over high heat on the grill. That's it!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Asparagus</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss the asparagus with olive oil, season, and grill until lightly charred.</li>
        <li>The asparagus should be perfectly cooked after three to five minutes on a lightly grill heated to high heat. You will know the asparagus spears are done when they are lightly charred and tender when pierced with a fork. </li>
    </ol>
